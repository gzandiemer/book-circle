    <h1>LIBSTA - Per Libris Ad Astra</h1>
    <img class="logo" alt="logo" src="@/assets/logo-books.png" />
    <p>Libsta is created to cover the need in Berlin for an alternative library</p>
    <p>German libraries do not have sufficient number of books in other languages.</p> 
    <p>With this web app, people will be able to connect their own libraries to one another</p>
    <p> and not only exchange books in a large community but also get in touch with people,</p>
    <p> whom they share a common book taste. </p>
